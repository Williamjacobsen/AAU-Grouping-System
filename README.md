## About the Project

Group formation at the beginning of a semester is stressful for both students and coordinators. The old physical method is chaotic and excludes people who can’t attend. Kurt Nørmark’s 2020 web tool solved many of those issues but has significant limitations in usability, communication, information richness and adoption among coordinators.
AAU-Grouping-System is a complete redesign that focuses on:

- **Intuitive UI/UX** – easy to learn for new coordinators
- **Rich student profiles** & preferences – better matching, less surprises later
- **Built-in real-time chat** - general, project-specific, group and direct messaging
- **Powerful coordinator tools** - drag-and-drop group editing, filtering, sorting, CSV export
- **Accessibility & responsiveness** - works on phones, tablets and laptops

## Features
